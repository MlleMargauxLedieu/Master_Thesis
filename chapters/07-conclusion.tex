\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chp:conclusion}
In Limitations, we can talk about the fact that we don't need to have a 100\% accuracy since geologist never agree completely on a sample. So it's okay to have different values of porosity or different components identification or different dunham classification. So even a 70\% accuracy resuylt is good simce this is more or les what geologist would agree upon
